# .ini - An C/C++ ini file handling library
.ini is an ini file handling library written in C++, which provides C's interface.



## Build

First of all, you need a [GenSol](//github.com/H1KHC/GenSol) to generate Makefile.

And then, just `make` to build it.

By now, this library only builds static version.



## Usage

There is a file named `ini.cpp`, which is the source of a ~~fake~~ command tool to manage and do operations with .ini file.

And it contains almost every operations the library will use.

In a nutshell, please turn to it if you don't know how to use this library.

~~Although I don't think this is hard to use after having a look at the header file...~~
